secure server
1) try denyhosts
2) move SSH to another port (less than 1024)
3) write script to run locally before SSH connect that
	- checks outgoing ip
	- makes API call to AWS to open SSH port to current ip address and block other ports for SSH
4) write local script and use pull or pole method to update app from private package
	- script should send email from each server when done
	- if this method then build in some public/private key method for verifying downloaded software is safe
